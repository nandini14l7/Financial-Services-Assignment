# Financial-Services-Assignment
Description
This project focuses on summarizing large texts and extracting key insights using advanced natural language processing techniques. It utilizes the BART model from Hugging Face's transformers library to process textual data, break it down into manageable chunks, summarize these chunks, and then extract meaningful insights relevant to financial health, risk factors, and strategic direction.

Features
Text Summarization: Condense long texts into brief, informative summaries.
Insight Extraction: Identify and present key information from the summarized texts focusing on specific categories like financial performance, risk assessment, and strategic planning.
Scalability: Designed to handle large documents by processing text in chunks.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated into larger systems for automated text analysis and reporting.
Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install these dependencies via pip:


Read and Process Text:
Load your textual data from a file and process it through the summarization pipeline. The script handles splitting the text into chunks and summarizing each chunk.

Extract Insights:
After summarization, the script extracts insights based on predefined categories and outputs these insights for further analysis or reporting.
